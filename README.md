# Convolutional Neural Network (Pixel Draw)

This is my final project during New York University's summer program in machine learning. We created a modified version of the game "Quick, Draw!" in which the user would draw a simple sketch on a 28 pixel by 28 pixel canvas. The program would predict if the drawing is an airplane, a car, or a clock. 

We used 454,923 total images of cars, airplanes, and clocks provided by Google's dataset from the game "Quick, Draw!" to train our convolutional neural network. We configured it to 5 epochs with batch sizes of 50 and the validation accuracy resulted in 98.7%.

Project written in Python on Google Colaboratory.
